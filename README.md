CAPSTONE-PROJECT-AMAZON-PRODUCT-REVIEW-ANALYSIS-THIS IS THE FINAL PROJECT OF MY COURSE IN NIIT FOR THE DATA SCIENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING PGP PROGRAM,THIS WAS A GROUP PROJECT AND OUR GROUP HAD TOTAL OF 5 MEMBERS.
WE HAD TO CHOOSE ANY TWO CATEGORIES OF THE AMAZON META DATA .THERE LOT OF DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF DATA AVAILABLE.WE CHOOSE THE HOME AND KITCHEN AND GROCERY CATEGORY .
WE WERE GIVEN CERTAIN OBJECTIVES ABOUT WHAT TO FIND .BASED ON THAT WE USED DIFFERENT MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS,NLP TECHNIQUES AND DATA VISUALIZATION TOOLS LIKE TABLEAU TO GATHER INSIGHTS.
THE PROJECT WAS MAINLY PERFORMED USING PYTHON AND TABLEAU.THE DATA WAS IN UNSTRUCTURED FORM SO WE HAD TO DO LOTS OF DATA CLEANING AND PREPROCESSING SO THAT THE DATA CAN BE ANALYZED.


MAIN OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT ARE:------
                                   1---TO ANALYSE THE CUSTOMER REVIEWS AND SENTIMENTS ON DIFFERENT PRODUCTS 
                                   2--- ANALYSING HOW THE CUSTOMER SENTIMENT AND REVIEWS ARE AFFECTING THE SALES OF DIFFERENT PRODUCTS
                                   3--- DOING PRODUCT RECOMMENDATION BASED ON THE CUSTOMER REVIEWS,CUSTOMER SENTIMENTS AND PRODUCT SALES
                                   4--- PREDICTING/FORECASTING FUTURE SALES 
                                   5--- GATHERING IMPORTANT BUSINESS TRENDS/INSIGHTS
                                                               
                                                               
                                                               
 THIS WAS A GROUP PROJECT SO WHATEVER WE DID WE DISCUSSED TOGETHER AND APPLIED IT TO GIVE THIS PROJECT A MEANINGFUL DIRECTION, THE SIZE OF THE DATA WAS A HUGE PROBLEM SO WE FACED LOTS OF PROBLEM TO LOAD THE DATA IN OUR LOCAL MACHINE AND ALSO THE DATA WA STOO UNSTRUCTRED TO LOT OF TIME WAS TAKEN TO MAKE IT STRUCTYRED 
 AND ALSO THE FOR THE DATA VUSUALIZATION PURPOSE WE USED TABLEAU MOSTLY AND FOR SOME TASKS WE USED PYTHON VISUALIZATION LIBRARIES
